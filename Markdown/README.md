## Profile

Senior Software Engineer with over five years of experience in software development, consulting and support services. 
Skilled in automation, tech leadership, agile methodologies, architecture and mentoring.
Always full of ideas and unconventional approach to problems, but still being able to see all the options and judge accurately. 
Willing to learn and improve, but at the same time to teach and help others.

Site Reliability Engineering Guild lead & evangelist. 
Go enthusiast, open source contributor and trainer.
Experienced in DevOps and reliable CI/CD practices.
Advocate for asynchronous teamwork and team morale over sticking to pre-fabricated templates.
I believe in continuous improvement not only in code, always learning something new.

Avid fan of remote working and work based on trust, not on numbers. 
I get stuff done (to put it mildly).

## Projects

### Asynchronous chat

Built a set of highly secure and highly available Go AWS lambdas utilising Amazon Lex & Connect functionality.
Fully integrated with DynamoDB, leveraging some of the automation provided by the database;
configured with AWS Secrets Manager, deployed over AWS Service Catalog.
Designed packages to abstract the logic within the packages and expose a simple and well documented API to use by other developers.

### AI-powered analysis & data scraping microservices

Designed and built a microservices suite for data scrapping and analysis using Go, PostgresDB and graph databases (dGraph, neo4j).
Reworked the POC written by a previous team to decrease the time of discovery from 12 hours to 10 minutes.
Utilised the power of Goroutines to make the solution scalable and asynchronous.
Introduced tiered logging to the service to increase observability

### AI-powered crime prevention systems

Built and maintained a set of microservices for video data processing and AI integration.
Using Google Cloud services, NodeJS and custom ffmpeg wrappers.
Increased the test coverage across the whole stack by 50%.

### Go-powered music video

Wrote first ever **[music video in Golang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-2EpUqb9g)**. 
Did everything apart from singing - wrote, record, mixed, mastered, planned out, wrote the video, released the video.

### Automated daily chores in terminal

If there's something I've been using to help me with my work/daily chores, 99/100 times I wrote an CLI for this. 
Blogging? Automated. Switching Git accounts? Automated. 
Creating new repositories without leaving the terminal? Automated.
Scrapping data to see if the flour I want is available and notifying me over various channels? Automated. And calling that package [bready-steady-go](https://github.com/youshy/bready-steady-go)? Done.

### Post-deployment integration tests

Designed a process & tooling system for validating web suite post-deployment. 
Decreased the time needed from 4 hours to 5 minutes.

### Data-visualisation boards

Harnessing the power of ServiceNOW, built a set of data boards visualising the state of service desk, SLIs and KPIs across different teams - which resulted in massive decrease of backlog and increased the speed of resolution.
