## Profile

As a Lead Software Engineer with over eight years of experience in IT, I bring a wealth of skills and experience to any team.
I specialize in **tech leadership, multicloud and microservice-based architecture, automation, agile methodologies**, and **mentoring**.
I have a unique approach to problem-solving, always full of ideas and eager to approach problems unconventionally.
However, I am also able to evaluate all options and make informed decisions.

One of my core values is a **willingness to learn and improve**.
At the same time, I am passionate about **teaching** and helping others.
I have presented at various **tech conferences**, including **GopherCon UK** in **London**, **ContainerDays** in **Hamburg** and **DevBCN** in **Barcelona** where I broke down complex technical concepts into easily digestible presentations that engaged and educated audiences of all levels.
I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others and am always seeking out new opportunities to contribute to the tech community.

Beyond work, I am committed to giving back by working with non-profit organizations like **Code First Girls** and **Colourintech**.
Through my work with these organizations, I help **empower women and underrepresented groups** to break into the tech industry.
I am passionate about creating a more **inclusive and diverse** industry and believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue a career in tech.
I am also heavily involved in the **Open-Source** community, trying to help out as much as I can, whenever I can - I've contributed to projects led by **Microsoft** or **Chef**, to mention a few.

In addition to my experience in software development, I bring a **remote-first** mentality and strong communication skills to my work.
Whether collaborating with colleagues or pursuing my diverse interests, I am comfortable working with people from different cultures and time zones.
This flexibility has allowed me to develop unique problem-solving skills and make valuable contributions to a range of projects.

Outside of work, I am a **music producer**, guitarist, composer, and songwriter, and I have a passion for exploring new sounds and creating original music.
To add on top of that, I wrote the first ever **[music video in Golang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-2EpUqb9g)**. 
I'm also a break maker and an amateur cook; electronics afficionado; powerlifer and a beginner carperter.
All of these experiences interpolate with each other, making me who I am.
